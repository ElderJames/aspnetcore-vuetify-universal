        section-text Choosing a framework can be a daunting task, and I'm not even talking about component frameworks. You've arrived at Vue and now it's time to start developing your next great idea. There are many options to choose from, and everyone says that they are great. So you have to decide, what are my metrics for success?
        section-text This was me almost a year ago. There were plenty of <strong>UI toolkits</strong> to choose from, but none them had everything that I needed...yeah, you've heard that before. Often enough though, it <em>is</em> the reason individuals attempt to create products that fill gaps, and is why I started working on Vuetify.
        section-text.mb-0 But now you are the one searching for that perfect framework, and Vuetify is another on a list of many, vying for your attention. While my opinion will be subjective, I will try to outline features that I believe will be valuable to you and/or your organization.

          span Design principles
        section-text Vuetify is developed exactly according to Material Design spec. Every component is hand crafted to bring you the best possible UI tools to your next great app. The development doesn't stop at the core components outlined in Google's spec. Through the support of community members and sponsors, additional components will be designed and made available for everyone to enjoy.

          span Comparison to other Frameworks
        section-text Vuetify is not the only Vue material framework out there. Plenty of other talented developers have created some amazing applications under the guise of Google's Material Design spec. Each offer their own unique take on development and process, however, here are a few things that set Vuetify apart:
        v-layout(row wrap)
          v-flex(xs12 sm8)
            v-subheader What you get:
