  headerText: 'Being a component framework, Vuetify will always grow horizontally. Depending on your project, a small **package size** may be a requirement. The A la carte system enables you to pick and choose which components to import, drastically _lowering_ your build size. **If you already have the `a-la-carte` template installed, you can skip to the [guide](/guides/a-la-carte#application)**.',
  headerText2: 'For a pre-built project demonstrating single component imports, install the **a-la-carte** template from the cli, using the command `vue init vuetifyjs/a-la-carte`. Some of our other templates also include options for enabling a-la-carte components. More information is located in the [Quick start guide](/getting-started/quick-start)',
  importHeader: 'Importing components',
  importText1: 'The `transform-imports` package is not necessary to use a-la-carte components, but simplifies the process of importing them, and is therefore **highly** recommended. It allows you to use a more concise syntax when importing components.',
  alert2: 'Keep in mind, both the `Vuetify` and `VApp` components are required to use Vuetify',
  alert3: 'The options object that you pass as the second argument to `Vue.use` can also include both a _directives_ and a _transitions_ property.',
  importText2: 'If you are not using the transform-imports package, you will need to import each component like this:',
  importText3: 'You can also import components in .vue files, as seen below. When doing so it\'s important that you import all named exports, and then destructure them in components. Otherwise child components such as `v-card-text` or `v-expansion-panel-content` will not be available.',
  styleHeader: 'Required styles',
  styleText1: 'In order to obtain all the required styles, we need to import them in stylus. In order for webpack to handle this, you will need to install `stylus` and the `stylus-loader` from **npm**.',
  alert4: 'For a more detailed explanation on how to setup your application to handle stylus, please navigate to the <a href="/style/themes">theme page</a>.',
  styleText2: 'Now you will need to require the stylus from the entry point of your application. This is the same place where you\'re importing Vue and Vuetify (usually `main.js` or `app.js`). Keep in mind, requiring this in your main `App.vue` can cause slow load times as it is re-processed when you make updates.',
  applicationHeader: 'Application',
  applicationText1: 'Navigate to the **src** folder and open up `main.js`. We see that in the template come some components already configured to load.',
  applicationText2: 'For example the code below tells the application that you use a `<v-app>`, `<v-navigation-drawer>`, `<v-footer>` and `<v-toolbar>`. Once defined, the markup can be used in any .vue file.',
  componentNameListHeader: 'UI Component Name List',
  componentNameListText1: 'Some components such as `VLayout` or `VFlex` are for organizational reasons included in other components, in this case `VGrid`. To know which component to import you can review the following table.',
