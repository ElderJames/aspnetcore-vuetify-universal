    "I know choosing a UI framework can be a daunting task -- there are so many options to choose from and every one of them claims that they are the best. So you have to decide for yourself: what are the metrics for success?",
    "This was me almost a year ago. There were plenty of UI toolkits to choose from, but none of them had everything that I needed, and that is why I started working on Vuetify.",
    "I am extremely humbled that you have considered using Vuetify as your next UI Framework. A lot of care has went into crafting the perfect setup for taking any idea from conception to production. I look forward to you joining the Vuetify community and am excited to see what incredible interfaces you create!"
